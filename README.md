## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - for typing

### What I learned

I used this challenge to practice some best practices with migrating code to
vite from create-react-app. Also I practice working with eslint code semantics.

```ts
/// <reference types="vite/client" />
```

Also, I practiced creating a theme guide based on style-guide markdown, which
worked and made it easier to style components. I will be doing that again on the
next challenge too. here is a sample of how made it:

```typescript
Breakpoint: {
    Mobile: "375px",
    Desktop: "1440px",
  },
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing using typescript and vite for small
challenges. I would also like to try using other libraries and frameworks like
Next.js, Angular, and svelte.

In addition, I would like to create a boilerplate for this challenges so that I
can work on them alittle faster.
